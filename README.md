# Product_Categorizer

Aim of this project is to develop a system which could first scrape Mamaearth's product details (like Product Name, Product Link, Rating, Reviews, MRP, Pack Size, Discount/Offers running on the product) and then use that data to train a product categorizer. Task of product categorizer will be to tell the category and key ingredient of a product based on the name of the product. So, taking Mamaearth Onion Hair Oil as an example, the key ingredient here is Onion and the category is Hair Oil.
